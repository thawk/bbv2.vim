This plug is based on http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2552, and cloned from https://github.com/xiterion/jam.vim.

To avoid conflicts with the builtin filetype/jam.vim, I change the filetype to bbv2 (Boost Build v2).

Defines a compiler named b2.

Unless g:bbv2_disable_project_detect is 0, this plugin will detect if a file is inside Boost Build project.  If so, set compiler to b2.
